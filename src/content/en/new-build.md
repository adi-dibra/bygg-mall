    heading: Scope model and typical new-build assignments
    intro: Clarify which project classes you deliver and under which contract model.
    body:
      - New-build projects often include long timelines and multiple stakeholder interfaces, so early definition of scope boundaries and responsibility structure is essential for both budget integrity and schedule reliability.
      - This section can be used to describe housing projects, education facilities, commercial assets, and industrial builds with clear role distribution between client organization, design teams, and contractor leadership.

    heading: Design coordination, procurement, and mobilization in one flow
    intro: Show how documents, materials, and site production are synchronized.
    body:
      - A robust new-build setup starts with coordinated document review before site execution. Linking procurement milestones to design maturity helps reduce late changes and protects production rhythm.
      - Use this section to explain how logistics routes, delivery windows, temporary facilities, and site safety controls are prepared before the first major build stage begins.
    bullets:
      - Coordinated design review before production start
      - Procurement strategy tied to build stage sequence
      - Site mobilization with logistics and safety planning

    id: risk
    heading: Risk and quality governance through all production stages
    intro: Explain how risk owners, controls, and escalation points are managed.
    body:
      - A practical risk model combines technical risk mapping with production-stage decision gates. When responsibilities, actions, and deadlines are defined early, timeline disturbance can be reduced significantly.
      - Continuous tracking of quality, safety, and commercial indicators gives both contractor and client a stronger basis for timely decisions throughout the contract.
    bullets:
      - Structured risk register by work package
      - Decision gates at each stage transition
      - Ongoing reporting on quality, time, and cost

    heading: Schedule control, reporting, and stakeholder communication
    intro: Show how planning and reporting are kept transparent for clients.
    body:
      - Predictable new-build delivery requires a stable reporting format that connects schedule, forecast, and resource status. This makes change management faster and lowers uncertainty in critical phases.
      - The template can be adapted with your exact routines for weekly updates, monthly forecasts, variance logs, and escalation channels.
