    heading: Strategic purpose and performance targets
    intro: Connect energy measures to operating cost, climate targets, and asset lifecycle value.
    body:
      - Energy upgrades generate stronger business value when scope decisions are based on measured baselines, lifecycle analysis, and operational constraints rather than isolated technical upgrades.
      - This structure lets you explain short-payback actions and longer investment tracks so clients can choose an implementation strategy aligned with risk profile and budget horizon.
    metrics:
      - label: Typical target domains
        value: Energy, comfort, reliability
      - label: Follow-up horizon
        value: 12 to 24 months

    id: baseline
    heading: Baseline analysis to prioritize the right measures
    intro: Explain how energy flows, systems, and building envelope conditions are evaluated.
    body:
      - A structured baseline assessment identifies where losses occur and which upgrade sequence gives the highest practical return. Combining site findings with metered data improves decision quality early.
      - Explicit assumptions, constraints, and risk factors should be documented so clients can compare measure packages with full transparency.
    bullets:
      - Envelope, system, and control-state mapping
      - Baseline profile for energy and power demand
      - Prioritization matrix by impact and payback

    heading: Implementation planning with low operational disruption
    intro: Show how measures are phased so user operations can continue safely.
    body:
      - Energy projects often involve multiple parallel system interventions, which makes sequencing and access planning critical. Early coordination with operations teams reduces downtime and practical conflict on site.
      - The template can be filled with your real method for phased installation, functional validation, and handover to client-side operations.
    bullets:
      - Phased schedule with defined access windows
      - Cross-discipline coordination model
      - Structured handover to operations and maintenance

    heading: Post-delivery verification and performance governance
    intro: Explain how calculated savings are compared with actual performance data.
    body:
      - The most important value stage in energy projects is verification. Comparing live post-delivery data against baseline and assumptions gives objective evidence of achieved impact.
      - A fixed reporting model with deviation analysis and corrective actions supports long-term value and helps clients prioritize future investments.
    metrics:
      - label: Initial performance check
        value: 30 days after commissioning
      - label: Deviation review cycle
        value: Monthly in first quarter
      - label: Final performance report
        value: At 12 months
