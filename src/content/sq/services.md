    id: structure
    heading: Expanded information model across all service pages
    intro: A deeper shared structure makes comparisons clearer and procurement decisions faster.
    body:
      - The deep-dive pages are organized around scope boundaries, risk controls, quality checkpoints, timeline logic, and staffing responsibilities.
      - Each section can describe early-stage assumptions, execution constraints, and stage-by-stage controls before milestone approvals.
      - A consistent model improves internal content maintenance and keeps external communication coherent across all service groups.
      - For clients, this provides stronger tender clarity, fewer misunderstandings during quote dialogue, and better confidence before project kickoff.
    bullets:
      - Scope and boundary definition by service type
      - Process model with execution checkpoints
      - Example deliverables and expected outcomes
      - Team roles and collaboration responsibility map
      - Quality and post-handover follow-up model
